# Spotify Genre Visualization and Playlist Filtering with Python
This is aprogram that utilizes the Spotify API to allow a user to enhance their Spotify experience with a focus on genres. The program has two main features. First, a visual representation of the userâ€™s top genres can be created. This visualization will also show a sample of the top songs that belong to each genre. Second, the user can filter a playlist by a specific genre, and then create a new playlist that only features songs of that genre. This means that rock and roll playlists, for instance, can easily be created using existing playlists and/or liked songs by a user. Users will also be able to remove genres from their top if they do not feel that genre fits them.

A couple of things are gonna be needed coming up for the next sprint
1.)
A way to transfer data from the template to the view and back to the next template 
This is gonna be done by creating a new view and new url and transferring the data using the url function 
General Idea:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22903438/django-how-to-pass-data-object-from-one-template-to-another-template

2.)
I need a way to access the top artists from each genre:

When the generate custimizable playlist button is pressed 
    it will have a variable associated with each radio button
    and the data will be 'submitted' to a view. 
I think the only thing that needs to be submitted is:
    the index of the genre, 
    and a variable short-term, medium-term, or long-term.
    Use $('input[name=toggle]:checked').val() to get the value of said variable which retrieves value="" which can be set to index of genre or time variable 
Since the top-genres will remain the same - 
    if I have a way to access that same genre list that was passed into data 
    then I can reuse that 'top-genre-list' on the customize page to generate the top artists in that genre in generate_menu template
    the genre dictionary should be global or a django equivilant 

3.)    
When retreiving the top artists from that genre
    list them as 'checked' buttons using same input:checked.val to dyamically add them to a dictionary
    use this dictionary to gchool_id):
    try:enerate playlist using the listed artists as seeds

4.)
Fix radio buttons
